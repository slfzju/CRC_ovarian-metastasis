# CRC_ovarian-metastasis
Colorectal cancer with Ovarian metastases (CRCOM) develops rapidly and lethal, 
but the mechanism of CRCOM is still unclear. It is urgent to explore the special molecular phenotype and metastatic pathway of CRCOM 
to prolong the survival period and improve the quality of life of CRCOM patients. 
In this manisript "Whole exome sequencing reveals molecular characterization and spreading routes of colorectal cancer with ovarian metastases",
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on multiple regions of matched primary CRC, normal tissues and all metastases from  patients with CRCOM.
the somatic mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), altered pathway and potential driver genes across CRCOM and TCGA-COAD cohorts were analyzed. 
The metastatic pathways of CRCOM by building clone trees with Pyclone and Clonevol were constructed.
